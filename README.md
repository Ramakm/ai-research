# Become an AI Master

A complete, hands-on to becoming a good AI Engineer.

This repository is designed to help you learn AI from first principles, build real neural networks, and understand modern LLM systems end-to-end.
You'll progress through math, PyTorch, deep learning, transformers, RAG, and OCR — with clean, intuitive Jupyter notebooks guiding you at every step.

Whether you're a beginner or an engineer levelling up, this repo gives you the clarity, structure, and intuition needed to build real AI systems.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Math Fundamentals
- Math functions, derivatives, vectors, and gradients
- Matrix operations and linear algebra
- Probability and statistics

### 2. PyTorch Basics
- Creating and manipulating tensors
- Matrix multiplication, transposing, and reshaping
- Indexing, slicing, and concatenating tensors
- Special tensor creation functions

### 3. Neural Networks
- Building neurons, layers, and networks from scratch
- Normalization techniques (RMSNorm)
- Activation functions
- Optimizers (Adam, Muon) and learning rate decay

### 4. Transformers
- Attention and self-attention mechanisms
- Multi-head attention
- Decoder-only transformer architecture

### 5. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Building RAG pipelines end to end
- Indexing, retrieval, chunking strategies
- Integrations with embedding models and vector stores

### 6. Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- OCR pipeline and utilities
- Preprocessing images and extracting text

## Learning Path

For a recommended step-by-step progression through the materials, see the Learning Path:

- `Start_here/learning_path.md`

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Recommended workflow:

1. Open Jupyter in the project root:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   # or
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Work through notebooks in order:
   - `1.Math/`
   - `2.PyTorch/`
   - `3.Neural-Networks/`
   - `4.Transformer/`

3. Folder to run separately:
   - `5.RAG/`
   - `6.OCR/`

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

Please ensure:

- Notebooks are clean (Restart & Run All before committing)
- Existing structure & naming conventions are followed
- PRs are focused, readable, and documented
- In folders like RAG and OCR, please maintain the cleaned structure part
- If you want to add something new folders, make it proper structure way.
